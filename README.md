# csSFC "Viologue Twilight" User Skin v1.05<br>

<b>11/22/2022</b> - Updated version to match 1.05 release. Nothing new, changed a colour for the SNES line art in the Info screen SVG, and added the "Export All BRR" to the sample screen.<br>
<br>
An <i><u>unofficial</i></u> Violet/Twilight colourscheme for chipsynth SFC 1.05<br>
<br>
DO NOT CONTACT PLOGUE IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS SKIN. They will not support it.<br>
NOTE: Use at your own risk. If chipsynth SFC is ever updated in the future, this skin's update basically depends on if I've updated it to support those new features. :)<br>
<br>
<i><b>How to Install:</b></i><br>
<br>
<b>Step 1</b> - Extract the archive<br><br>
&#8226; Windows<br>
